 Fun, is a word that is easily thrown around. Have fun they say, but what exactly does that mean?

To me, to have fun is to enjoy what you are doing. Simple. Right? But, just have fun is not realistic. The truth is you are not always going to have fun. Realistically, you'll come across a few roadblocks, some will be easy to pass others will knock you off your course. 

When it comes to coding, it's fun, creative, and challenging. But sometimes the challenging part isn't fun. I'm sure everyone who has ever attempted to code can agree that at times coding is not fun. In fact,  at times it can be grueling, daunting and just terrifying. But what separates coders from non-coders is that we love to learn, and most importantly we love challenging ourselves. That's where the fun part comes in when you get stuck on a problem and sometimes feel discouraged but somehow the code worrier in you gets back at it and powers through then a breakthrough happens where you found the solution, there is nothing more fun that. That is where the fun begins.

So, Have fun, yes. But, be realistic, know that it is not always going to be fun. But you are not learning to code because it's fun if it was then everyone would do it. So, remember, you chose to challenge yourself and to master your new skill. The fun part happens when you overcome every new challenge. So have fun.
