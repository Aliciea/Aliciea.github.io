The next step was to figure out how someone like myself enters a male dominating industry?  For years, I dabbled with the idea of becoming a developer. I like computers, I like solving problems and I'm super creative! Sign me up, right? But, I didn't see women like myself represented in the tech field. So, gathering up the courage to apply to an immersive program took 3 years. 

At first, I didn't share my enthusiasm with my love ones. I needed to see if software engineering was right for me. It wasn't too long before I'd put my then 1-year-old to bed then jump in on a free online course in HTML and CSS. I fell in love with programming. The pure excitement of being able to create a basic app with just those two languages was exhilarating. Sign me up!  Next, I took a one-day online course in javascript and discovered my new passion. Javascript wasn't easy, but I loved that I was learning something completely new, unlike anything I've experienced. Like most who entered this field, I found myself suited up in a local coffee shop learning the basics of javascript. I struggled a lot with Javascript but the more I dove right in the bigger my confidence grew.

It's been a journey that has allowed me to discover both my strengths and weaknesses. What's most profound about starting a career in software engineering is that I don't have a background in computer science, academically I struggled in school, however, whenever I get stuck rather than give up, I face my fears and give it all I got and it always pays off in the end. That one problem that I was struggling with I've learned to master. It's not rocket science and you don't need a computer science degree to get started. 

Starting a career in software engineer is rewarding. It's about not having the answers, not being part of the culture but if you give it your all it pays off. You don't need to be a male or have a master's in mathematics. Software engineering is a forgiving field. Anyone can enter with very little experience. All you need is discipline. And love what you do. I've learnt how to face my fears.
